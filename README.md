# MPU9250
Kris Winer's MPU9250 library

This repository comes from a few different source files created by [Kris Winer](https://github.com/kriswiner) to support the MPU9250 9-DOF Internal Measurement Unit.  Mostly I just re-organized Kris's 
[source code](https://github.com/kriswiner/MPU9250/tree/master/MPU9250_BME280_SPIFlash_Ladybug) into the modern Arduino library format (class header and implmentation in <b>src</b> folder, example in <b>examples</b> folder) and simplified up one of his [examples](https://github.com/kriswiner/MPU9250/blob/master/MPU9250_BME280_SPIFlash_Ladybug/MPU9250_BME280_SPIFlash_Ladybug.ino) by removing code requiring components other than the MPU9250.
